# spellcamp
The purpose of this project is to create high quality English dictation resource for anyone who wants to improve her\his spellings. Each package is divided into sessions. Each session has a list of words and corresponding dictation voices. 
For example, the **general word list** is divided into 182 sessions. Each session has about 20 words. There are two files for each session. One is a text file and other is a voice file. Text file has all the words you are supposed to learn and voice file is a dictation file you need to listen to do practice of spellings you learnt. So if you are learning words from the **general word list**, you should first learn all the word spellings in the text file `session_01.txt` and then practice by listening `session_01.ogg` and writing the spellings on a paper or in a text editor.
